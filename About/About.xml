Vanilla matching wall corners. Made by BirdMan! and continued by RadZerp.

This mod contains 3 wall types:
Beveled walls wrap seamlessly with vanilla walls and allow for less sharp corners. Stats are identical to vanilla.
Diagonal walls look like half-blocks, are cheaper and weaker, but otherwise behave like vanilla.
Diagonals are experimental and allow for things such as "1-tile wide" diagonal corridors. This is accomplished by turning them PassThroughOnly which also means they don't block most things.

All 3 types contain horizontal and vertical pieces that help transitioning from diagonal structures into regular stuff.

Since these walls mostly don't fully occupy a tile, they also allow building floors underneath them.
